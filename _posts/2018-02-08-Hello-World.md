title: Welcome to my Blog!

This is my first post on this blog :):):).

On this blog I will be detailing the things that I am learning and my thoughts in this journey of mine to become a Machine Learning ninja. please also forgive my writing(I am not much of a writer), but I reckon I will definately get better with time. The following is just a brief background of where I am coming from and where I am heading(hope to) in the ML world.

My name is Marshall Mahachi, and I am an aspiring ML engineer. First got introduced to the world of ML through Andrew Ng's course on Coursera (This was in 2014 - lol). I didn't manage to finish the course that year, neither the following year (work pressure, switching jobs inbetween - I was working as a Tellecomunications Engineer at that time). Anyway, restarted and finished the course in 2017 (determination - took me more than 3 months; also did a couple other courses R, MySQL etc...). After that I did the first course of Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, then that's when I came accross the [FastAI](http://www.fast.ai/) lectures - decided to focus on those instead (I kind of resonate with the style of learning).

2018, my plan this year is to keep building my portfolio and working on kaggle competitions till I reach that mastery level :):).
