title: Learning Data Visualization
---

So Kaggle now has very helpful tutorials on learning various aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning. I am going to
go over all the tutorials on the site and will be noting down what I would have leant on theis blog site. I am going to start with 
the Visualization Track then will move on to the Machine learning track and then the Deeplearing track.

I trust that it's not going to take me more than 2 hours to finish the data visualization tutorials. The following are the contents of the
tutorial:
<ol type='i'>
  <li>Univariate Plotting with Pandas</li>
  <li>Bivariate Plotting with Pandas</li>
  <li>Plotting with Seaborn</li>
  <li>Multivariate Plotting</li>
  <li>Plotting with plotly</li>
</ol>
