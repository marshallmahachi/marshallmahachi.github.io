So Kaggle now has very helpful tutorials on learning various aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning. I am going to
go over all the tutorials on the site and will be noting down what I would have leant on theis blog site. I am going to start with 
the Visualization Track then will move on to the Machine learning track.

For those that do not know, Kaggle is more like the Github of the Data Science world. I do belive that at some point or even now, 
a kaggle account is going to be one of the most important factors in dertermining employability of Data Scientists.So head over to kaggle
and just browse the site.
